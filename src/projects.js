        description: "A project created in Hack with a Pro 2024 that won 3rd place overall. Users can share leftover ingredients with their friends through a communal fridge which can be accessed through a unique code. Our Fridge uses email notifications to let a friend know that a user wants an ingredient, and generates easy recipes that can use the leftover ingredients accumulated by the group. I used React.js to implement ingredient requesting and fridge display (organized by food category). Shoutout to Yifan, Jacky, Warrick, Chanh, and Ellen for being a great team!",

To help students control their bad working habits such as bad posture, phone usage, and more, FocusView tracks user eye movement and posture data in each session with a pomodoro timer.

        description: "A project created with UCLA Creative Labs in Fall 2023/Winter 2024. Clearify is a cosmetic shopping browser extension that scans a productâ€™s ingredients list as you shop and checks if a cosmetic is safe for your skin, e.g. silicone-free, alcohol-free, or FA-safe (fungal acne-safe), using the community-trusted EWG Skin Deep Database. I used Manifest V3, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to add highlights and property counts to the extension that matched the sleek design and feel of Clearify.",
